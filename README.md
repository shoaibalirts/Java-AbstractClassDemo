# Abstract Classes

<p>if we inherit the class from the abstract class then inherited class has to give implementation of the abstract class</p>
<p>if inherited class can not give implementation of its parent then the inheritted class will also become abstarct class</p>
<p>We can not instantiate object from the abstract class, but we can point to the child class due to polymorphism</p>
